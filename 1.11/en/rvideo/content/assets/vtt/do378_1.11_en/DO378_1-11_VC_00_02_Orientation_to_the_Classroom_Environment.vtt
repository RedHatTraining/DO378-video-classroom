00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
Let's have a look at the
Classroom Lab environment first.

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.150
So the only system actually

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.440
that we are going to use for our
work is the workstation system.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.410
It is a Linux desktop,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.810
providing you all the tools that
we need to complete this course,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.015
along with all the exercises.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.760
It is connected to the student network,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.045
which has an outgoing
router called bastion,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:35.080
which in turn is connected to the
classroom infrastructure network,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.710
giving it access to the
classroom virtual machine.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.000
So you see all 3 of those
in your virtual machine list.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.100
The function of the
bastion VM is just that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.484
of connecting the workstation
to the external internet.

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:57.050
However, the classroom
virtual machine does

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.020
have 2 virtual hosts
configured on it.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.635
The content and the
materials.example.com,

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:06.695
which are used to serve various materials

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:11.330
to the workstation as
needed by the exercises.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.230
You can consult the classroom
machine table if you want to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.115
get more details on the actual IPs,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:22.535
on each of those, although
shouldn't be needed because

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:27.200
every single virtual machine is
reachable by its DNS hostname.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.320
When you log in and enter the course,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.905
you will be able to see a tab
called a Lab Environment.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:37.520
Initially, this lab is
going to be in deleted state.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.415
So you will be able to create it first,

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.490
create the virtual machines for your work

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.910
and they are going to progress
through a couple of states,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.575
from being non-existent

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:58.640
to being in a waiting to
start and PUBLISHING state,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.680
which are the first 2 stages.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.895
They don't really take long,

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.445
then they are going to be in
the STARTING state for awhile.

00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.375
And ultimately they end
up in a STARTED state.

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:12.545
You can see them in the
list of virtual machines

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:17.180
towards the bottom of the
lab environment, overview.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.050
The automatic shutdown timer
counts initially from 1 hour.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.265
So make sure that if you intend to
work for a longer amount of time,

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:33.110
you click the plus button next to it.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.350
As you can see, the
maximum amount that you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.540
can schedule your class
to be up for, is 12 hours.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.480
After that, the plus button disappears.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.605
And this is to help you preserve your
learning subscription lab hours.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:57.245
Now, if you want to stop it immediately
because you have finished your work,

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.960
you can simply go on and
click the STOP button

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.385
And in that case,

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.580
the virtual machines are
going to go through first

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.585
the STOPPING state and then
eventually into the STOPPED state.

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:11.780
So this is non-destructive operation,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.990
the state of your virtual machine
is preserved across restarts.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.035
Of course, initially, you can

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:26.360
create the lab and that creates the
virtual machine in the initial state.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.879
And if at some point
you want to completely

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.640
wipe out and restart
your work from scratch,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.365
you can also DELETE the lab,

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.659
wait for it to disappear,

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.805
and then create it all over again.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:40.370
Individual virtual machines may

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.260
have several actions
associated with them. Generally

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.620
we don't use these individual
virtual machine actions unless

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.400
explicitly told by the course book to,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.340
for example, reset a particular system.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.590
But since in this course
the workstation is

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.085
the only system that we are
actively working with,

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:05.540
there is no need to use these
except for the OPEN CONSOLE button,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.885
which will open the virtual
machine in a new tab.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:12.755
So you might have to allow pop-ups
from rol.redhat.com.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.930
And if you see a blank screen like this,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.640
just wiggle the mouse a little bit.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.795
It's the screensaver that
is on or press any key

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:23.720
and you will be able to login
as the student user with

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.410
the password of student,
all small letters.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.660
Couple of tricks in the
virtual machine viewer.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.280
The screen is size down to
the size of your browser,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.625
so if you need or want a high resolution,

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:44.165
make sure that your browser
window is large enough first

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:48.800
and then you can use the Activities
button in the top left corner

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.975
of the screen and simply
start typing displays

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:57.545
and you will be able to
see that displays icon,

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.680
which will allow you to
change the resolution of

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.715
the screen to something that
is more comfortable for you.

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:08.570
Of course, as I said, if you
choose too large a resolution,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.600
it will be scaled down to
the browser window size.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.745
So it might end up actually
having worse picture quality than

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.550
what you had wanted. 
When it comes to

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.075
typing and working with
the virtual machine,

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:31.805
you will probably want to
paste some text at some point in time.

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:36.725
What you need to make sure is that the
window we want to paste into, is active

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:41.165
and then click the T button
here in the top right corner,

00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:43.790
where you can type or copy

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.825
the text that you want to
send to the virtual machine.

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:53.030
And click Send, which will
simulate the keystrokes and make

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.920
the text appear in your active window.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.700
If at some point in time you
either lose the connection to

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.135
the VM console or you accidentally close
it pressing Control W, for example,

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.200
it might happen that one or
more of your modifier keys,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.715
that is Control, Alt,

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:19.520
Shift, and so on, get stuck.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.550
So when trying to type,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.330
you may see weird things
happen in the terminal.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.705
And if you want to remediate that

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.530
there is a button next 
to the right most

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.280
one in the top-right corner
called release modifier keys.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.530
If you click that one, it should fix

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.870
your keyboard and allow you
to type on and start working,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.650
where you left off. If at
some point you want to enter

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.000
a key combination that is not supported
by the virtual machine viewer,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.750
you can always pop up
the virtual keyboard by

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.220
clicking on the middle button
in the top right corner,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.180
which will bring up the virtual
keyboard and allow you to simulate

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.630
key clicks as if they were pressed
on your actual physical keyboard.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:19.250
Inside the class, you have several
developer tools such as VSCodium,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.155
which we are going to explore in
one of the upcoming exercises.

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:29.730
Apache Maven is already pre-installed
and ready for you to use.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.410
And everything is set for you to

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.489
start working on your
first Quarkus applications.

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:42.680
Join us in the next video, where we're going

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.049
to discuss microservice architectures.
