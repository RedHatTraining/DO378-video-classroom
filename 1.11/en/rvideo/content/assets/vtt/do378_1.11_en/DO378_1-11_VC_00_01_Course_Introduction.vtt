00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
My name is Grega Bremec
and I am an instructor for Red

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.020
Hat Training. In the past

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.465
I have been a developer,
and a system engineer.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.460
I have been working with Linux, Unix,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.470
and open source software
for over 2 decades

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.789
by now. I'd like to invite
you to join us in D0378,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.290
the Red Hat Cloud Native microservices
development with Quarkus,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.900
where we are going to be learning
about the principles of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.020
architecture and
implementing microservices

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.840
based on Red Hat Build of Quarkus 1.11

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.900
and OpenShift Container
Platform 4.6

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.240
We will be building on Java EE
application development fundamentals.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.585
And we will be learning about
how to develop, monitor, test,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:45.860
and deploy the Cloud Native
Architecture microservice in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.680
both local environment
and OpenShift. Quarkus is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.859
an exciting new technology
because it brings the maturity,

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.570
the familiarity, and the reliability
of Enterprise Java to our Cloud native,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.610
Container native framework that has

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.315
super fast startup times and
extremely small binaries.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:06.590
This course is meant for application
developers that already have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.150
a basic understanding and familiarity
of web application development in Java,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.725
or have taken the Red Hat
Application Development 1 course,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.240
programming in Java EE,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.490
which is known as JB183,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.865
or have an equivalent
Enterprise Java experience.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:27.830
And who are proficient in
using Visual Studio Code or

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.140
Red Hat code ready Studio or any other
IDE in developing their applications.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.050
In addition, experience with Maven and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.290
version control is
recommended but not required.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.305
And also, having a look
at the introduction to

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:47.450
OpenShift applications DO101
is recommended but not required either.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.660
If you're excited to start learning
about this cool new technology,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.420
join me in the DO378 course.
